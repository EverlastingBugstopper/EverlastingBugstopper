### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer with a focus on automation and developer tooling. Check out [averyharnish.com](https://averyharnish.com) for my [personal site](https://github.com/EverlastingBugstopper/avery-site).

#### Professional Repositories 

In the past I've worked at [Engine](https://engine.com), [Apollo GraphQL](https://apollographql.com) and [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com). 

At Apollo, I worked on the [ðŸ¤– Rover CLI](https://github.com/apollographql/rover). Related repositories are [`federation-rs`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation-rs), [`router`](https://github.com/apollographql/router), [`awc`](https://github.com/EverlastingBugstopper/awc) and [`apollo-rs`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-rs).

At Cloudflare, I worked on v1 of the [ðŸ¤  Wrangler CLI](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler). Related repositories are [`kv-asset-handler`](https://github.com/cloudflare/kv-asset-handler), [`worker-typescript-template`](https://github.com/cloudflare/worker-typescript-template), [`workers-docs`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-docs), and [`worker-sites-template`](https://github.com/cloudflare/worker-sites-template).

#### Open Source Repositories

I also maintain some open source Rust crates. Check out [`shell-candy`](https://github.com/EverlastingBugstopper/shell-candy) if you want to shell out to a sub-process and handle their `stdout`/`stderr` as streams. Or, you can check out [`billboard`](https://github.com/EverlastingBugstopper/billboard) if you want to display boxes with outlines in your terminal.
